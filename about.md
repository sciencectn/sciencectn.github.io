Sometime when I was in middle school, my grandmother set up me up with my own website: chrisfun.com. 

(This is started to sound like those origin stories you read on the back of food labels. 
Except they're definitely made up and the actual origin story is: *some shareholders wanted to make money and the marketing team invented some characters to sell it*. 
Anyway, mine's legit because...trust me.)

Anyway, I posted all sorts of *quality* Flash animations and photoshopped *art*. And `.exe` files that you definitely shouldn't run.

chrisfun.com disappeared. I probably moved on to other things and we let the domain expire. 

Years later, I felt like reviving it by creating this site. I wanted to combine that same authentic free expression and chaos of a 12 year old with professional multimedia tools with hopefully useful bits of wisdom about software engineering. But the chrisfun.com domain is crazy expensive for some reason, so now we have chrisfun.xyz. 

About me: I'm a software engineer specializing in embedded systems in high stakes situations: scary machines in industrial environments (trains, forklift trucks, robots, drones, etc). 

I mess around with many things in my free time: like making music, writing, reading sci-fi, occasionally writing things, photography, wondering about the Fermi paradox, and cooking (mostly finding ways to automate it).
