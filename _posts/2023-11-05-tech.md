Some people are [convinced](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/xvhfmw/facebook_is_listening_really/) that Meta is eavesdropping on them through the Facebook app. 

Rumors like these bother me and not because I'm a supporter of Meta. Rather, it's because it delivers Meta *way* more power than they deserve and leads to despondent sentiments like this: 
- *What's the point? They have all my data anyway.*
- *I'll just accept that they're listening to everything I say.*

Except, Meta isn't that clever and this kind of eavesdropping would be hilariously difficult to implement and conceal. Believing such rumors is like submitting to the Dark Side before realizing that Darth Vader's lightsaber is made of plastic. 

Meta, like most of Big Tech, acquires its power by exploiting money and the law. Not because they're super geniuses with out-of-this-world technology[^1]. 

## Why eavesdropping would be hilariously difficult to get away with

When most people think of the Facebook app accessing the microphone, they probably have an image like this in their heads:

Already, this simplified architecture shows a weakness. It's possible to turn the tables and eavesdrop on the Facebook app to see what it's up to, as many have done already[^2].

But let's look at the other side. Can the Facebook app actually access the microphone like that? 

If you make electronics, you probably use Digikey. A quick look at their microphone selection shows [1,821 results](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/microphones/158) spread across 31 manufacturers. 

The reality is more like this:

That's a ridiculous amount of work, even for Meta. Android and Apple, to make things easier on app developers, abstract away those details.

And this is why it's insanely difficult for Meta to pull this off. They have to go through the middleman that is Google or Apple's phone operating system. 

It's possible to swap the middleman for a modified one that exposes more information about apps (for example [TaintDroid](http://www.appanalysis.org)). 



- todo: should still regulate them 
- examples where they screwed up and got hacked
- change FB -> Meta? 
- instagram difficulty, distributed systems
