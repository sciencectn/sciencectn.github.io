title: The less aligned you are, the more communication bandwidth you need

Suppose you get an assignment over email.

It makes *no* sense. The more you read it, the more confused you get. Eventually [semantic satiation](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71855/why-does-word-sometimes-lose-all-meaning) takes over and there's aren't even words anymore. What's the next best course of action?

1. Do it anyway, to the best of your interpretation, then show them the results. 
2. Ask for clarification with a followup email. 
3. DM or text them.  
4. Call them. 
5. Meet with them face-to-face. 

Early in my career, I probably would have gone with options 1-3. 

Yes, I've actually done option 1. Probably I was too scared to ask because imposter syndrome kept telling me: *well clearly everyone else can understand them and I can't because I'm dumb.*

I've also seen others make this mistake many times, causing lots of needless pain and arguments. 

The more I do this, the more I realize that the best option is the last: meet with them face-to-face. To quote [User Stories Applied](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/user-stories-applied/0321205685/): 
> It seems so easy to think that if everything is written down and agreed to then there can be no disagreements, developers will know exactly what to build, testers will know exactly how to test it, and, most importantly, customers will get exactly what they wanted. Well, no, that's wrong: Customers will get the developers' interpretation of what was *written down*, which may not be exactly what they *wanted*. 

Yes, I get it. Meeting face-to-face can be overwhelming if you're not aligned. You have to balance technical concepts, the onslaught of information from tone and body language, and emotions all at the same time. It's much easier to type a quick email, hit send, then resume  ~~that Wikipedia rabbit hole~~ creating value for your shareholders. 

However, it's necessary because meeting face-to-face *essentially establishes a new language*. 

Unlike programming languages, spoken languages are basically invented as we go along. 
If I throw out some technical jargon like *CI/CD, static analysis, pipeline, failing test, fail fast*, I might be making no sense to people in other fields. 
If you're a chemical engineer, you might think pipeline refers to something that moves fluids around. 
But anyone who has worked with me in software probably knows exactly what I'm talking about (since I tend not to shut up about such things. Again, thanks for your patience). 

Back to the example above. If you're surrounding by rowers, you might instantly associate the word *sweep* with the practice of [sweep rowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_rowing). In a military context, *sweep* might mean searching for security hazards. If you're a janitor, *sweep* means using a broom to collect debris. 

This is a simple example that I can explain in writing. But you can probably see how, if lots of such misaligned terms get thrown around, people can get into awkward disagreements. The benefit of face-to-face communication is you can pause the speaker in real time and ask for clarification. That feedback loop in person lasts seconds, over instant message or email could be hours or days. 

If you disagree with this post then let's meet for coffee.
